# PrimaryPart-Master
[**Link to plugin**](https://www.roblox.com/library/5051177870/PrimaryPart-Master)

This is a source code of my Roblox plugin that adds an invisible PrimaryPart to the center of selected models.


## How It Works
Once the plugin is installed, you can select any model in your workspace and press the button to add an invisible PrimaryPart to the center of the model. The invisible PrimaryPart is useful for centering the model in other parts of your game, such as for physics or collisions.

The plugin also detects if the selected model contains a VehicleSeat and inherits its orientation. This makes it easy to add an invisible PrimaryPart to a vehicle model and ensure that it is correctly oriented.

## Usage
    Select the models that you want to add an invisible PrimaryPart to
    Click on the plugin button in the toolbar
    An invisible PrimaryPart will be added to the center of the selected models
    If the selected model contains a VehicleSeat then the newly made PrimaryPart will inherit its orientation
