This is a source code of my Roblox plugin that **adds an invisible `PrimaryPart`** to the center of selected models.
Furthermore, it inherits the orientation of `VehicleSeat` when present.

## How It Works
Once the plugin is installed, you can select models in your workspace and press the button to add an invisible `PrimaryPart` for each of selected models. The invisible `PrimaryPart` is useful for centering models within other elements of your game, such as for physics and collisions.

The plugin also detects if the selected model contains a `VehicleSeat` and inherits its orientation. This makes it easy to add an invisible `PrimaryPart` to a vehicle model and ensure that it is correctly oriented.

## Usage
- Select the models that you want to add an invisible `PrimaryPart` to
- Click the plugin's button on the toolbar
